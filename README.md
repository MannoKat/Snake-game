# Snake Game
This repository contains the implementation of the classic game Snake in C, as part of the requirements for CSCI0300 - Introduction to Computer Systems at Brown University.

# Description
The Snake game is a simple arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game screen.

# Getting Started
To run the game, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can compile the program using the provided Makefile or by manually compiling the source files. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/MannoKat/Snake-game.git
```

2. Compile the source code:
```
make
```
3. Run the compiled executable:
```
./snake
```
# Controls
Use the keys (up: w, down: s, left: a, right: d) to control the direction of the snake.
Features
Simple and intuitive gameplay.
Randomized food generation.
Collision detection for both snake body and game boundaries.
Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
